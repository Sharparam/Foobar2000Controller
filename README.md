==========================================================

Currently only monitors song changes from Foobar2k, cannot control anything.

Clone this repo and do whatever you want with it, but please consider giving credit if you reuse my code!

You need to have the module [foo_controlserver](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=38114) enabled in Foobar2k for this application to be able to connect and receive song information.
